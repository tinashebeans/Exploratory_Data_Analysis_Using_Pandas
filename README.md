# Background
Following my Google Data Analytics certificate from [Coursera](), I was really hungry to improve my SQL skills and as I was going thruogh youtube I came across this amaizing SQL course from [Luke Barousse](https://www.youtube.com/@LukeBarousse) the Data Nerd. It is well structured, easy to follow and taught me new skills that I am using in my other projects.

Special thanks to Luke and Kelly Adams for this amazing SQL course and thank you for sharing your invaluable knowledge with the world.
